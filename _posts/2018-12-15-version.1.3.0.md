We are happy to announce the next stable release of Storm in version 1.3.0.
<!--more-->

This release features, among others, heavily extended [JANI]({{ '/documentation/background/languages.html#jani' | relative_url }}) support, improvements in `storm-gspn` and for Markov Automata.
Moreover, two new binaries are provided: `storm-conv` for conversions between model files and `storm-pomdp` that translate POMDPs to pMCs.
For more information, please check the [release notes](https://github.com/moves-rwth/storm/releases/tag/1.3.0).

We also updated the Homebrew formula, so users who installed Storm via homebrew are able to update Storm by

```console
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade stormchecker
```

If you experience any bugs, please [let us know]({{ '/documentation/obtain-storm/troubleshooting.html#file-an-issue' | relative_url }}).
