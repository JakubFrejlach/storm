We are happy to announce the next stable release of Storm in version 1.4.0.
<!--more-->

This release features, among others, updates in multi-objective model checking and multi-objective queries.
Furthermore, it allows monotonicity checking in parametric models, and the analysis of DFTs has been improved significantly. 
For more information, please check the [release notes](https://github.com/moves-rwth/storm/releases/tag/1.4.0).

We also updated the Homebrew formula, so users who installed Storm via homebrew are able to update Storm by

```console
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade stormchecker
```

If you experience any bugs, please [let us know]({{ '/documentation/obtain-storm/troubleshooting.html#file-an-issue' | relative_url }}).
