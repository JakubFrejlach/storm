<h1>Running Storm on DFTs</h1>

{% include includes/toc.html %}

## Analyzing DFTs

The support for fault tree analysis is bundled in the `storm-dft` binary which should be created during the [build]({{ '/documentation/obtain-storm/build.html#build-step' | relative_url }}). The input of Dynamic fault trees (DFTs) is given in the [Galileo format]({{ '/documentation/background/languages.html#dfts' | relative_url }}).

#### Example 1 (Fault tree analysis of a motorbike)

We consider the example of a motorbike with a front wheel and a rear wheel. When one of the wheels fails, the spare wheel can be used as a replacement. If more than one wheel fails, the whole motorbike fails. The fault tree for the motor bike is given in the following.

{% include includes/show_model.html name="DFT file of motorbike" class="dft_motorbike" path="dft/motorbike.dft" %}

For the fault tree analysis two measures are of importance: *reliability* and *mean-time-to-failure (MTTF)*. The reliability at time t=1 can be computed with the following call:

```console
$ storm-dft -dft motorbike.dft --timebound 1
```

{% include includes/show_output.html class="dft_motorbike_timebound" path="dft/motorbike_timebound.out" %}

At time t=1 the probability of having a failure of the motorbike is 35.78%.

For a better indication of the reliability over time multiple time points can be computed at once:
```console
$ storm-dft -dft motorbike.dft --timepoints 1 5 0.1
```

{% include includes/show_output.html class="dft_motorbike_timepoints" path="dft/motorbike_timepoints.out" %}

Here the reliability for all time points $$1+i\cdot0.1, i \in \{0, ..., 40\}$$ is computed.

The second measure MTTF computes the expected time of the failure of the motorbike.

```console
$ storm-dft -dft motorbike.dft -mttf
```

{% include includes/show_output.html class="dft_motorbike_mttf" path="dft/motorbike_mttf.out" %}

The motorbike has an expected lifetime of 1.61.

#### Example 2 (Fault tree analysis of the Hypothetical Example Computer System (HECS))

In this example we consider the *Hypothetical Example Computer System (HECS)* from the NASA handbook on fault trees. It models a computer system consisting of a processor unit with two processors and a spare processor, a memory unit with 5 memory slots, an operator interface consisting of hardware and software, and a 2-redundant bus.

{% include includes/show_model.html name="DFT file of HECS" class="dft_hecs" path="dft/hecs.dft" %}

We compute the MTTF again.

```console
$ storm-dft -dft hecs.dft -mttf
```

{% include includes/show_output.html class="dft_hecs_mttf" path="dft/hecs_mttf.out" %}

As the system is larger, it makes sense to use *symmetry reduction* as an optimization.
This is enabled by default for all analyses and exploits symmetries in the system, for example stemming from redundant components.
Symmetry reduction reduces the model size drastically which improves the analysis time.

For reliability another optimization can be enabled: *modularisation* via `--modularisation`.

```console
$ storm-dft -dft hecs.dft --timebound 500 --modularisation
```

{% include includes/show_output.html class="dft_hecs_timebound_mod" path="dft/hecs_timebound_mod.out" %}

Here independent subtrees are analyzed separately and the results are combined yielding the total reliability.
